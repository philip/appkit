# Interface: ResourceFieldEntry

Defines a single field for a resource. Each field has its own environment variable and optional description. Single-value types use one key (e.g. id); multi-value types (database, secret) use multiple (e.g. instance_name, database_name or scope, key).

This interface was referenced by `PluginManifest`'s JSON-Schema
via the `definition` "resourceFieldEntry".
