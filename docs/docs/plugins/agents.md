# Agents

The `agents` plugin turns a Databricks AppKit app into an AI-agent host. It loads agent definitions from markdown files (convention: `config/agents/*.md`), from TypeScript (`createAgent(def)`), or both, and exposes them at `POST /invocations` alongside routes for chat, thread management, and cancellation.

This page covers the full lifecycle. For the hand-written primitives (`tool()`, `mcpServer()`), see [tools](./server.md).

## Install

`agents` is a regular plugin. Add it to `plugins[]` alongside `server()` and any ToolProvider plugins whose tools you want agents to reach.

```ts
import { agents, analytics, createApp, files, server } from "@databricks/appkit";

await createApp({
  plugins: [server(), analytics(), files(), agents()],
});
```

That alone gives you a live HTTP server with `POST /invocations` wired to a markdown-driven agent.

## Level 1: drop a markdown file

```
my-app/
  server.ts
  config/agents/
    assistant.md
```

```md
---
endpoint: databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5
default: true
---

You are a helpful data assistant running on Databricks.

Use the available tools to query data, browse files, and help users.
```

On startup the plugin:

1. Discovers the file at `./config/agents/assistant.md`.
2. Parses the YAML frontmatter and markdown body as the agent's `instructions`.
3. Resolves the adapter from `endpoint` (or falls back to `DATABRICKS_AGENT_ENDPOINT`).
4. Auto-inherits every registered ToolProvider plugin's tools (`analytics.*`, `files.*`, …).
5. Mounts the agent at the default name (`assistant`).

Requests land at `POST /invocations` with an OpenAI Responses-compatible body. Every tool call runs through `asUser(req)` so SQL executes as the requesting user, file access respects Unity Catalog ACLs, and telemetry spans are created automatically.

## Level 2: scope tools in frontmatter

```md
---
endpoint: databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5
toolkits:
  - analytics                             # all analytics.* tools
  - files: [uploads.read, uploads.list]   # only these files tools
  - genie: { except: [getConversation] }  # everything but getConversation
tools: [get_weather]                      # ambient tool declared in code
default: true
---

You are a read-only data analyst.
```

When any `toolkits:` or `tools:` is declared the auto-inherit default is turned off — the agent sees exactly the listed tools. Ambient tools (`tools: [get_weather]`) are looked up in the `agents({ tools: { ... } })` config.

## Level 3: code-defined agents

```ts
import {
  agents,
  analytics,
  createAgent,
  createApp,
  files,
  fromPlugin,
  server,
  tool,
} from "@databricks/appkit";
import { z } from "zod";

const support = createAgent({
  instructions: "You help customers with data and files.",
  model: "databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5",                  // string sugar
  tools: {
    ...fromPlugin(analytics),                             // all analytics tools
    ...fromPlugin(files, { only: ["uploads.read"] }),     // filtered subset
    get_weather: tool({
      name: "get_weather",
      description: "Weather",
      schema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ city }) => `Sunny in ${city}`,
    }),
  },
});

await createApp({
  plugins: [server(), analytics(), files(), agents({ agents: { support } })],
});
```

Code-defined agents start with no tools by default. `fromPlugin(factory)` is the primary way to pull in a plugin's tools — it returns a spread-friendly marker that the agents plugin resolves against registered `ToolProvider`s at setup time. No intermediate variable, no duplicate `plugins: [analyticsP, filesP, ...]` dance: you write the factory reference once inside `fromPlugin` and again in `plugins: [...]`.

The asymmetry (file: auto-inherit, code: strict) matches the personas: prompt authors want zero ceremony, engineers want no surprises.

### Scoping tools in code

`fromPlugin(factory, opts?)` accepts the same `ToolkitOptions` as markdown frontmatter:

| Option | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `only` | `{ only: ["query"] }` | Allowlist of local tool names |
| `except` | `{ except: ["legacy"] }` | Denylist of local tool names |
| `prefix` | `{ prefix: "" }` | Drop the `${pluginName}.` prefix |
| `rename` | `{ rename: { query: "q" } }` | Remap specific local names |

For plugins that don't expose a `.toolkit()` method (e.g., third-party `ToolProvider` plugins authored with plain `toPlugin`), `fromPlugin` falls back to walking `getAgentTools()` and synthesizing namespaced keys (`${pluginName}.${localName}`). The fallback respects `only` / `except` / `rename` / `prefix` the same way.

If a referenced plugin is not registered in `createApp({ plugins })`, the agents plugin throws at setup with an `Available: …` listing so you can fix the wiring before the first request.

## Level 4: sub-agents

```ts
const researcher = createAgent({
  instructions: "Research the question. Return concise bullets.",
  model: "databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5",
  tools: { search: tool({ /* ... */ }) },
});

const writer = createAgent({
  instructions: "Draft prose from notes.",
  model: "databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5",
});

const supervisor = createAgent({
  instructions: "Coordinate researcher and writer.",
  model: "databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5",
  agents: { researcher, writer },  // exposed as agent-researcher, agent-writer
});

await createApp({
  plugins: [
    server(),
    agents({ agents: { supervisor, researcher, writer } }),
  ],
});
```

Each key in `agents: {...}` on an `AgentDefinition` becomes an `agent-<key>` tool on the parent. When invoked, the agents plugin runs the child's adapter with a fresh message list (no shared thread state) and returns the aggregated text. Cycles are rejected at load time.

## Level 5: standalone (no `createApp`)

```ts
import { createAgent, runAgent, tool } from "@databricks/appkit";
import { z } from "zod";

const classifier = createAgent({
  instructions: "Classify tickets: billing | bug | feature.",
  model: "databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5",
  tools: {
    lookup_account: tool({ /* ... */ }),
  },
});

for (const ticket of tickets) {
  const result = await runAgent(classifier, {
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: ticket.body }],
  });
  await persistClassification(ticket.id, result.text);
}
```

`runAgent` drives the adapter without `createApp` or HTTP. Inline `tool()` calls work standalone as shown above. To use plugin tools in standalone mode, pass the plugin factories through `RunAgentInput.plugins` — `runAgent` will resolve any `fromPlugin` markers in the def against that list:

```ts
import { analytics, createAgent, fromPlugin, runAgent } from "@databricks/appkit";

const classifier = createAgent({
  instructions: "Classify tickets. Use analytics.query for historical data.",
  model: "databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5",
  tools: { ...fromPlugin(analytics) },
});

const result = await runAgent(classifier, {
  messages: "is ticket 42 a duplicate?",
  plugins: [analytics()],
});
```

Hosted tools (MCP) are still `agents()`-only since they require the live MCP client. Plugin tool dispatch in standalone mode runs as the service principal (no OBO) since there is no HTTP request.

## Configuration reference

```ts
agents({
  dir?: string | false,         // "./config/agents" default; false disables
  agents?: Record<string, AgentDefinition>,
  defaultAgent?: string,
  defaultModel?: AgentAdapter | Promise<AgentAdapter> | string,
  tools?: Record<string, AgentTool>,
  autoInheritTools?: boolean | { file?: boolean, code?: boolean },
  threadStore?: ThreadStore,    // default in-memory
  baseSystemPrompt?: false | string | (ctx: PromptContext) => string,
  mcp?: {
    trustedHosts?: string[],    // extra hostnames allowed for custom MCP URLs
    allowLocalhost?: boolean,   // default: NODE_ENV !== "production"
  },
  approval?: {
    requireForDestructive?: boolean,  // default: true
    timeoutMs?: number,               // default: 60_000
  },
  limits?: {
    maxConcurrentStreamsPerUser?: number, // default: 5
    maxToolCalls?: number,                // default: 50
    maxSubAgentDepth?: number,            // default: 3
  },
})
```

`autoInheritTools` defaults to `{ file: false, code: false }` — no tools spread into any agent unless the developer explicitly opts in. When opted in, only tools whose plugin author marked `autoInheritable: true` are spread; destructive or state-mutating tools are always skipped from the auto-inherit path even when opt-in is enabled. Boolean shorthand (`autoInheritTools: true`) applies to both origins. See "Auto-inherit posture" below.

### MCP host policy

AppKit applies a zero-trust policy to every MCP URL used as a hosted tool. By default only **same-origin Databricks workspace URLs** (matching the resolved `DATABRICKS_HOST`) may be reached. Every other host must be explicitly allowlisted via `mcp.trustedHosts`, and workspace credentials (service-principal and on-behalf-of user tokens) are **never** forwarded to those hosts.

```ts
agents({
  agents: {
    support: createAgent({
      instructions: "…",
      tools: {
        "mcp.internal": mcpServer("internal", "https://mcp.corp.internal/mcp"),
      },
    }),
  },
  mcp: {
    trustedHosts: ["mcp.corp.internal"],
  },
});
```

The policy enforces four rules at MCP `connect()` time, before any byte is sent:

1. Only `http` and `https` URLs are accepted.
2. Plaintext `http://` is rejected for everything except `localhost` when `allowLocalhost` is true (default in development, off in production).
3. The destination hostname must match the workspace host, equal `localhost` (if permitted), or appear in `trustedHosts`.
4. The resolved DNS address must not fall in loopback, RFC1918, CGNAT (100.64.0.0/10), link-local (169.254.0.0/16 — covers cloud metadata services), ULA, or multicast ranges.

`Authorization` headers carrying workspace credentials are scoped to same-origin workspace URLs. A `mcpServer(name, url)` pointing at a trusted external host must authenticate itself (for example, a custom token baked into `url`).

### Auto-inherit posture

AppKit treats auto-inherit as a two-key operation: the developer must opt into `autoInheritTools`, AND the plugin author must mark each tool `autoInheritable: true`. Both are required for a tool to spread into an agent's index without explicit wiring.

```ts
// Opt-in at the agents plugin level (pick one):
agents({ autoInheritTools: true });                   // both origins
agents({ autoInheritTools: { file: true } });         // markdown agents only
agents({ autoInheritTools: { file: true, code: true } });

// Per-tool, inside a plugin:
defineTool({
  description: "safe read",
  schema: z.object({ ... }),
  annotations: { readOnly: true, requiresUserContext: true },
  autoInheritable: true, // explicit consent that this tool may auto-spread
  handler: ...,
});
```

The AppKit core plugins ship with the following `autoInheritable` markings:

| Tool | `autoInheritable` | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `analytics.query` | yes | OBO-scoped, `readOnly: true` enforced at runtime |
| `files.list` / `files.read` / `files.exists` / `files.metadata` | yes | OBO-scoped read operations |
| `files.upload` / `files.delete` | no | Mutating — wire explicitly |
| `genie.getConversation` | yes | Read-only history |
| `genie.sendMessage` | no | State-mutating Genie conversation |
| `lakebase.query` | no | Already gated by `exposeAsAgentTool`; auto-inherit stays closed as defense-in-depth |

Third-party `ToolProvider` plugins that don't expose a `toolkit()` method are also skipped from the auto-inherit path — their tools must be wired via `tools:` explicitly. At setup the agents plugin logs what each agent inherited and what was skipped so the posture is visible:

```
[agents] [agent support] auto-inherited 2 tool(s): analytics.query, files.uploads.read
[agents] [agent support] auto-inherit skipped 3 tool(s) not marked autoInheritable: files(2), genie(1). Wire them explicitly via `tools:` if needed.
```

### SQL agent tools

Two built-in agent tools can execute SQL on behalf of the LLM: `analytics.query` (against the Databricks SQL warehouse) and the opt-in `lakebase.query` (against a Lakebase Postgres database). Both have distinct safety postures because they run with different privileges.

**`analytics.query`** runs under the caller's OBO token (the end user's Databricks credentials). Its `readOnly: true` annotation is enforced at execution time — statements are tokenized and only `SELECT`, `WITH`, `SHOW`, `EXPLAIN`, `DESCRIBE`, and `DESC` are accepted. Writes, DDL, and stacked statements are rejected before the request reaches the warehouse:

```ts
// accepted
analytics.query({ query: "SELECT * FROM main.sales.orders WHERE created_at > current_date() - 7" })

// rejected at the plugin, never reaches the warehouse
analytics.query({ query: "UPDATE main.sales.orders SET status = 'cancelled'" })
analytics.query({ query: "SELECT 1; DROP TABLE main.sales.orders" })
```

**`lakebase.query`** is **not registered as an agent tool by default**. Enabling it is an explicit decision because the Lakebase pool is bound to the application's service principal: an agent with access to this tool can execute SQL as the SP regardless of which end user initiated the request. Opt in with an acknowledgement flag:

```ts
lakebase({
  exposeAsAgentTool: {
    iUnderstandRunsAsServicePrincipal: true,
    readOnly: true, // default
  },
});
```

With `readOnly: true` (default), the same SQL classifier as `analytics.query` applies, and the accepted statement is additionally wrapped in `BEGIN READ ONLY; … ROLLBACK;` so the Postgres server rejects any write that slips past the classifier (e.g., a `SELECT` over a side-effecting function). The tool annotations are `{ readOnly: true, destructive: false }`.

With `readOnly: false`, the tool accepts arbitrary SQL and is annotated `{ readOnly: false, destructive: true }`. The `destructive` annotation triggers the human-in-the-loop approval gate (below) on every invocation.

### Human-in-the-loop approval for destructive tools

Any tool annotated `destructive: true` requires explicit user approval before execution. Secure by default: set `approval.requireForDestructive: false` only for fully autonomous back-office agents running in single-user contexts.

Flow:

1. Before running the tool, the agents plugin emits an `appkit.approval_pending` SSE event carrying the pending call's `approval_id`, `stream_id`, `tool_name`, `args`, and `annotations`.
2. The chat client renders an approval prompt (see the reference app's approval card).
3. The same user who initiated the stream posts the decision to `POST /api/agent/approve`:

   ```http
   POST /api/agent/approve
   Content-Type: application/json
   X-Forwarded-User: <end-user id>
   X-Forwarded-Access-Token: <OBO token>

   { "streamId": "...", "approvalId": "...", "decision": "approve" | "deny" }
   ```
4. If approved, the tool executes normally and the stream continues. If denied, the adapter receives the string `"Tool execution denied by user approval gate (tool: <name>)."` as the tool output and the LLM can apologise / replan. If no decision arrives within `approval.timeoutMs` (default 60 s), the gate auto-denies.

The route enforces that the decider is the stream owner: an approve from a different `x-forwarded-user` returns `403`. Cancelling the stream via `POST /api/agent/cancel` denies every pending approval on that stream.

### Resource limits

The plugin enforces a handful of caps to protect a single-instance deployment from runaway prompts, misbehaving clients, or prompt-injected delegation cycles. Some are static (enforced by the request schema) and some are configurable via `agents({ limits: { ... } })`.

**Static caps** (applied at `POST /chat` and `POST /invocations` request parsing):

| Field | Cap | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `chat.message` | 64 000 characters | ~16k tokens; larger bodies are almost certainly abuse. |
| `invocations.input` string | 64 000 characters | Same reasoning. |
| `invocations.input` array | 100 items | Prevents a single request seeding hundreds of messages into the thread store. |
| `invocations.input[].content` string | 64 000 characters | Per-seeded-message cap. |
| `invocations.input[].content` array | 100 items | Per-seeded-message cap. |

**Configurable caps** (defaults shown):

```ts
agents({
  limits: {
    maxConcurrentStreamsPerUser: 5,  // HTTP 429 + Retry-After when exceeded
    maxToolCalls: 50,                // aborts the run if the budget is exhausted
    maxSubAgentDepth: 3,             // rejects sub-agent recursion beyond this
  },
});
```

The `maxToolCalls` budget is shared across the top-level adapter and every sub-agent it delegates to, so a prompt-injected fan-out cannot escape by going deeper. `maxConcurrentStreamsPerUser` is per-user, not global — one user hitting their limit does not affect others.

## Runtime API

After `createApp`, the plugin exposes:

```ts
appkit.agents.list();               // => ["support", "researcher", ...]
appkit.agents.get("support");       // => RegisteredAgent | null
appkit.agents.getDefault();         // => "support"
appkit.agents.register(name, def);  // dynamic registration
appkit.agents.reload();             // re-scan the directory
appkit.agents.getThreads(userId);   // list user's threads
```

## Frontmatter schema

| Key | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` | string | Model serving endpoint name. Shortcut for `model`. |
| `model` | string | Same as `endpoint`; either works. |
| `toolkits` | array of string or `{ name: options }` | Spread plugin toolkits. Supports `only`, `except`, `rename`, `prefix`. |
| `tools` | array of string | Keys into `agents({ tools: {...} })`. |
| `default` | boolean | First file with `default: true` becomes the default agent. |
| `maxSteps` | number | Adapter max-step hint. |
| `maxTokens` | number | Adapter max-token hint. |
| `baseSystemPrompt` | false \| string | Per-agent override. `false` disables the AppKit base prompt. |
| `ephemeral` | boolean | If `true`, the thread created for a chat request against this agent is deleted from `ThreadStore` after the stream finishes. Use for stateless one-shot agents (e.g. autocomplete) so history does not accumulate or contaminate future calls. Defaults to `false`. |

Unknown keys are logged and ignored. Invalid YAML and missing plugin/tool references throw at boot.
