# Files plugin

File operations against Databricks Unity Catalog Volumes. Supports listing, reading, downloading, uploading, deleting, and previewing files with built-in caching, retry, and timeout handling via the execution interceptor pipeline.

**Key features:**
- **Multi-volume**: Define named volumes (e.g. `uploads`, `exports`) and access them independently
- CRUD operations on Unity Catalog Volume files
- Streaming downloads with content-type resolution
- Inline raw serving with XSS-safe content type enforcement
- Upload size limits with streaming enforcement
- Automatic cache invalidation on write operations
- Custom content type mappings
- Per-user execution context (OBO)
- **Access policies**: Per-volume policy functions that gate read and write operations

## Basic usage

```ts
import { createApp, files, server } from "@databricks/appkit";

await createApp({
  plugins: [
    server(),
    files(),
  ],
});
```

Set `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_*` environment variables in your `app.yaml` (or `.env`). The plugin auto-discovers them at startup:

```bash
DATABRICKS_VOLUME_UPLOADS=/Volumes/catalog/schema/uploads
DATABRICKS_VOLUME_EXPORTS=/Volumes/catalog/schema/exports
```

That's it — no `volumes` config needed. The env var suffix becomes the volume key (lowercased):

| Environment variable         | Volume key |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_UPLOADS`  | `uploads`  |
| `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_EXPORTS`  | `exports`  |

## Auto-discovery

The plugin scans `process.env` for keys matching `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_*` and registers each as a volume with default `{}` config. Env vars with an empty value or the bare `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_` prefix (no suffix) are skipped.

**Merge semantics:** auto-discovered volumes are always merged with explicitly configured ones. Explicit config wins for per-volume overrides (e.g., `maxUploadSize`), while discovered-only volumes get default settings.

```ts
// Explicit overrides for uploads; exports is auto-discovered from env
files({
  volumes: {
    uploads: { maxUploadSize: 100_000_000 },
  },
});
```

This produces two volumes (`uploads` with a 100 MB limit, `exports` with defaults), assuming both `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_UPLOADS` and `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_EXPORTS` are set.

## Configuration

```ts
interface IFilesConfig {
  /** Named volumes to expose. Each key becomes a volume accessor. */
  volumes?: Record<string, VolumeConfig>;
  /** Operation timeout in milliseconds. Overrides the per-tier defaults. */
  timeout?: number;
  /** Map of file extensions to MIME types (priority over built-in map). Inherited by all volumes. */
  customContentTypes?: Record<string, string>;
  /** Maximum upload size in bytes. Defaults to 5 GB. Inherited by all volumes. */
  maxUploadSize?: number;
}

interface VolumeConfig {
  /** Access policy for this volume. */
  policy?: FilePolicy;
  /** Maximum upload size in bytes for this volume. Overrides plugin-level default. */
  maxUploadSize?: number;
  /** Map of file extensions to MIME types for this volume. Overrides plugin-level default. */
  customContentTypes?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

### Per-volume overrides

Each volume inherits the plugin-level `maxUploadSize` and `customContentTypes` unless overridden:

```ts
files({
  maxUploadSize: 5_000_000_000, // 5 GB default for all volumes
  customContentTypes: { ".avro": "application/avro" },
  volumes: {
    uploads: { maxUploadSize: 100_000_000 }, // 100 MB limit for uploads only
    exports: {},                              // uses plugin-level defaults
  },
});
```

### Permission model

There are three layers of access control in the files plugin. Understanding how they interact is critical for securing your app:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Unity Catalog grants                           │
│  (WRITE_VOLUME on the SP — set at deploy time)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Execution identity                             │
│  HTTP routes → always service principal         │
│  Programmatic → SP by default, asUser() for OBO │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  File policies                                  │
│  Per-volume (action, resource, user) → boolean  │
│  Only app-level gate for HTTP routes            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **UC grants** control what the service principal can do at the Databricks level. These are set at deploy time via `app.yaml` resource bindings. The SP needs `WRITE_VOLUME` — the plugin declares this via resource requirements.
- **Execution identity** determines whose credentials are used for the actual API call. HTTP routes always use the SP. The programmatic API uses SP by default but supports `asUser(req)` for OBO.
- **File policies** are application-level checks evaluated **before** the API call. They receive a `FilePolicyUser` describing the caller and decide allow/deny. On HTTP routes the user is extracted from the `x-forwarded-user` header when present; when the header is absent, the policy receives `{ id: <sp-id>, isServicePrincipal: true }` and decides for itself whether to allow service-principal traffic. This is the only gate that distinguishes between users on HTTP routes.

:::warning

Since HTTP routes always execute as the service principal, removing a user's UC `WRITE_VOLUME` grant has **no effect** on HTTP access — the SP's grant is what's used. Policies are how you restrict what individual users can do through your app.

:::

:::info New in v0.21.0

File policies are new. Volumes without an explicit policy now default to `publicRead()`, which **denies all write operations** (`upload`, `mkdir`, `delete`). If your app relies on write access, set an explicit policy — for example `files.policy.allowAll()` — on each volume that needs it.

:::

#### Access policies

Attach a policy to a volume to control which actions are allowed:

```ts
import { files } from "@databricks/appkit";

files({
  volumes: {
    uploads: { policy: files.policy.publicRead() },
  },
});
```

#### Actions

Policies receive an action string. The full list, split by category:

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| Read | `list`, `read`, `download`, `raw`, `exists`, `metadata`, `preview` |
| Write | `upload`, `mkdir`, `delete` |

#### Built-in policies

| Helper | Allows | Denies |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `files.policy.publicRead()` | all read actions | all write actions |
| `files.policy.allowAll()` | everything | nothing |
| `files.policy.denyAll()` | nothing | everything |

#### Composing policies

Combine built-in and custom policies with three combinators:

- **`files.policy.all(a, b)`** — AND: all policies must allow. Short-circuits on first denial.
- **`files.policy.any(a, b)`** — OR: at least one policy must allow. Short-circuits on first allow.
- **`files.policy.not(p)`** — Inverts a policy. For example, `not(publicRead())` yields a write-only policy (useful for ingestion/drop-box volumes).

```ts
// Read-only for regular users, full access for the service principal
files({
  volumes: {
    shared: {
      policy: files.policy.any(
        (_action, _resource, user) => !!user.isServicePrincipal,
        files.policy.publicRead(),
      ),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Custom policies

`FilePolicy` is a function `(action, resource, user) → boolean | Promise<boolean>`, so you can inline arbitrary logic:

```ts
import { type FilePolicy, WRITE_ACTIONS } from "@databricks/appkit";

const ADMIN_IDS = ["admin-sp-id", "lead-user-id"];

const adminOnly: FilePolicy = (action, _resource, user) => {
  if (WRITE_ACTIONS.has(action)) {
    return ADMIN_IDS.includes(user.id);
  }
  return true; // reads allowed for everyone
};

files({
  volumes: { reports: { policy: adminOnly } },
});
```

#### Enforcement

- **HTTP routes**: Policy checked before every operation. Denied → `403` JSON response with `Policy denied "{action}" on volume "{volumeKey}"`.
- **Programmatic API**: Policy checked on both `appkit.files("vol").list()` (SP identity, `isServicePrincipal: true`) and `appkit.files("vol").asUser(req).list()` (user identity). Denied → throws `PolicyDeniedError`.
- **No policy configured**: Defaults to `files.policy.publicRead()` — read actions are allowed, write actions are denied. A startup warning is logged encouraging you to set an explicit policy.

### Custom content types

Override or extend the built-in extension → MIME map:

```ts
files({
  volumes: { data: {} },
  customContentTypes: {
    ".avro": "application/avro",
    ".ndjson": "application/x-ndjson",
  },
});
```

Dangerous MIME types (`text/html`, `text/javascript`, `application/javascript`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`) are blocked to prevent stored-XSS when files are served inline via `/raw`.

## HTTP routes

Routes are mounted at `/api/files/*`. All routes execute as the service principal. Before each operation the volume policy runs: user identity comes from the `x-forwarded-user` header when present, otherwise the policy is handed `{ id: <sp-id>, isServicePrincipal: true }` and decides whether to allow the call. See [Access policies](#access-policies).

| Method | Path                       | Query / Body                 | Response                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/volumes`                 | —                            | `{ volumes: string[] }`                           |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/list`         | `?path` (optional)           | `DirectoryEntry[]`                                |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/read`         | `?path` (required)           | `text/plain` body                                 |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/download`     | `?path` (required)           | Binary stream (`Content-Disposition: attachment`)  |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/raw`          | `?path` (required)           | Binary stream (inline for safe types, attachment for unsafe) |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/exists`       | `?path` (required)           | `{ exists: boolean }`                             |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/metadata`     | `?path` (required)           | `FileMetadata`                                    |
| GET    | `/:volumeKey/preview`      | `?path` (required)           | `FilePreview`                                     |
| POST   | `/:volumeKey/upload`       | `?path` (required), raw body | `{ success: true }`                               |
| POST   | `/:volumeKey/mkdir`        | `body.path` (required)       | `{ success: true }`                               |
| DELETE | `/:volumeKey`              | `?path` (required)           | `{ success: true }`                               |

The `:volumeKey` parameter must match one of the configured volume keys. Unknown volume keys return a `404` with the list of available volumes.

### Path validation

All endpoints that accept a `path` parameter enforce:
- Path is required (non-empty)
- Maximum 4096 characters
- No null bytes

### Raw endpoint security

The `/:volumeKey/raw` endpoint serves files inline for browser display but applies security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`
- Unsafe content types (HTML, JS, SVG) are forced to download via `Content-Disposition: attachment`

## Execution defaults

Every operation runs through the interceptor pipeline with tier-specific defaults:

| Tier         | Cache | Retry | Timeout | Operations                            |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Read**     | 60 s  | 3x    | 30 s    | list, read, exists, metadata, preview |
| **Download** | none  | 3x    | 30 s    | download, raw                         |
| **Write**    | none  | none  | 600 s   | upload, mkdir, delete                 |

Retry uses exponential backoff with a 1 s initial delay.

The download timeout applies to the stream start, not the full transfer.

## Cache isolation

Cache keys include the volume key, ensuring volumes have independent caches. For example, `uploads:list` and `exports:list` are cached separately.

Write operations (`upload`, `mkdir`, `delete`) automatically invalidate the cached `list` entry for the parent directory of the affected volume.

## Programmatic API

The `exports()` API is a callable that accepts a volume key and returns a `VolumeHandle`. The handle exposes all `VolumeAPI` methods directly (service principal, logs a warning) and an `asUser(req)` method for OBO access (recommended).

```ts
// OBO access (recommended)
const entries = await appkit.files("uploads").asUser(req).list();
const content = await appkit.files("exports").asUser(req).read("report.csv");

// Service principal access (logs a warning encouraging OBO)
const entries = await appkit.files("uploads").list();

// Named accessor
const vol = appkit.files.volume("uploads");
await vol.asUser(req).list();
```

### VolumeAPI methods

| Method            | Signature                                                                                          | Returns            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `list`            | `(directoryPath?: string)`                                                                         | `DirectoryEntry[]` |
| `read`            | `(filePath: string, options?: { maxSize?: number })`                                               | `string`           |
| `download`        | `(filePath: string)`                                                                               | `DownloadResponse` |
| `exists`          | `(filePath: string)`                                                                               | `boolean`          |
| `metadata`        | `(filePath: string)`                                                                               | `FileMetadata`     |
| `upload`          | `(filePath: string, contents: ReadableStream \| Buffer \| string, options?: { overwrite?: boolean })` | `void`          |
| `createDirectory` | `(directoryPath: string)`                                                                          | `void`             |
| `delete`          | `(filePath: string)`                                                                               | `void`             |
| `preview`         | `(filePath: string)`                                                                               | `FilePreview`      |

> `read()` loads the entire file into memory as a string. Files larger than 10 MB (default) are rejected — use `download()` for large files, or pass `{ maxSize: <bytes> }` to override.

## Path resolution

Paths can be **absolute** or **relative**:

- **Absolute** — starts with `/`, must begin with `/Volumes/` (e.g. `/Volumes/catalog/schema/vol/data.csv`)
- **Relative** — prepended with the volume path resolved from the environment variable (e.g. `data.csv` → `/Volumes/catalog/schema/uploads/data.csv`)

Path traversal (`../`) is rejected. If a relative path is used and the volume's environment variable is not set, an error is thrown.

The `list()` method with no arguments lists the volume root.

## Types

```ts
// Re-exported from @databricks/sdk-experimental
type DirectoryEntry = files.DirectoryEntry;
type DownloadResponse = files.DownloadResponse;

interface FileMetadata {
  /** File size in bytes. */
  contentLength: number | undefined;
  /** MIME content type of the file. */
  contentType: string | undefined;
  /** ISO 8601 timestamp of the last modification. */
  lastModified: string | undefined;
}

interface FilePreview extends FileMetadata {
  /** First portion of text content, or null for non-text files. */
  textPreview: string | null;
  /** Whether the file is detected as a text format. */
  isText: boolean;
  /** Whether the file is detected as an image format. */
  isImage: boolean;
}

type FileAction =
  | "list" | "read" | "download" | "raw"
  | "exists" | "metadata" | "preview"
  | "upload" | "mkdir" | "delete";

interface FileResource {
  /** Relative path within the volume. */
  path: string;
  /** The volume key (e.g. `"uploads"`). */
  volume: string;
  /** Content length in bytes — only present for uploads. */
  size?: number;
}

interface FilePolicyUser {
  /**
   * Identifier of the requesting caller. For end-user HTTP requests this is
   * the value of the `x-forwarded-user` header; for direct SDK calls and
   * header-less HTTP requests (which run as the service principal), this
   * is the service principal's ID.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * `true` when the call is executing as the service principal — either a
   * direct SDK call (`appKit.files(...)`) or an HTTP request that arrived
   * without an `x-forwarded-user` header.
   */
  isServicePrincipal?: boolean;
}

type FilePolicy = (
  action: FileAction,
  resource: FileResource,
  user: FilePolicyUser,
) => boolean | Promise<boolean>;

interface VolumeConfig {
  /** Access policy for this volume. */
  policy?: FilePolicy;
  /** Maximum upload size in bytes for this volume. */
  maxUploadSize?: number;
  /** Map of file extensions to MIME types for this volume. */
  customContentTypes?: Record<string, string>;
}

interface VolumeAPI {
  list(directoryPath?: string): Promise<DirectoryEntry[]>;
  read(filePath: string, options?: { maxSize?: number }): Promise<string>;
  download(filePath: string): Promise<DownloadResponse>;
  exists(filePath: string): Promise<boolean>;
  metadata(filePath: string): Promise<FileMetadata>;
  upload(filePath: string, contents: ReadableStream | Buffer | string, options?: { overwrite?: boolean }): Promise<void>;
  createDirectory(directoryPath: string): Promise<void>;
  delete(filePath: string): Promise<void>;
  preview(filePath: string): Promise<FilePreview>;
}

/** Volume handle: all VolumeAPI methods (service principal) + asUser() for OBO. */
type VolumeHandle = VolumeAPI & {
  asUser: (req: Request) => VolumeAPI;
};
```

## Content-type resolution

`contentTypeFromPath(filePath, reported?, customTypes?)` resolves a file's MIME type:

1. Check `customContentTypes` map first (if configured).
2. Match the file extension against the built-in map.
3. Fall back to the server-reported type, or `application/octet-stream`.

Built-in extensions: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`, `.ico`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.xml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.sql`, `.pdf`, `.ipynb`, `.parquet`, `.zip`, `.gz`.

## User context

HTTP routes always execute as the **service principal** — the SP's Databricks credentials are used for all API calls. User identity is extracted from the `x-forwarded-user` header and passed to the volume's [access policy](#access-policies) for authorization. When the header is absent the policy is handed `{ id: <sp-id>, isServicePrincipal: true }` and decides whether to allow the call — in practice that branch only fires in development without a reverse proxy or when an upstream proxy is misconfigured, since real Databricks Apps runtimes always forward the header. This means UC grants on the SP (not individual users) determine what operations are possible, while policies control what each user is allowed to do through the app.

The programmatic API returns a `VolumeHandle` that exposes all `VolumeAPI` methods directly (service principal) and an `asUser(req)` method for OBO access. Calling any method without `asUser()` runs the policy with `isServicePrincipal: true`. In production, `asUser(req)` throws `AuthenticationError.missingToken` when the `x-forwarded-user` header is missing. In development (`NODE_ENV === "development"`) it falls back to the service principal instead, so local testing without a reverse proxy continues to work.

## Resource requirements

Volume resources are declared **dynamically** via `getResourceRequirements(config)` based on discovered + configured volumes. Each volume key generates a required resource with `WRITE_VOLUME` permission and a `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_{KEY_UPPERCASE}` environment variable.

For example, if `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_UPLOADS` and `DATABRICKS_VOLUME_EXPORTS` are set, calling `files()` generates two required volume resources validated at startup — no explicit `volumes` config needed.

## Error responses

All errors return JSON:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "plugin": "files"
}
```

| Status | Description                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | Missing or invalid `path` parameter                            |
| 403    | Policy denied "`{action}`" on volume "`{volumeKey}`"          |
| 404    | Unknown volume key                                             |
| 413    | Upload exceeds `maxUploadSize`                                 |
| 500    | Operation failed (SDK, network, upstream, or unhandled error)  |

## Frontend components

The `@databricks/appkit-ui` package provides ready-to-use React components for building a file browser:

### FileBrowser

A composable set of components for browsing, previewing, and managing files in a Unity Catalog Volume:

```tsx
import {
  DirectoryList,
  FileBreadcrumb,
  FilePreviewPanel,
} from "@databricks/appkit-ui/react";

function FileBrowserPage() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", gap: 16 }}>
      <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <FileBreadcrumb
          rootLabel="uploads"
          segments={["data"]}
          onNavigateToRoot={() => {}}
          onNavigateToSegment={() => {}}
        />
        <DirectoryList
          entries={[]}
          onEntryClick={() => {}}
          resolveEntryPath={(entry) => entry.path ?? ""}
        />
      </div>
      <FilePreviewPanel selectedFile={null} preview={null} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

See the [Files (UC) components](../api/appkit-ui/files/DirectoryList) reference for the full props API.
